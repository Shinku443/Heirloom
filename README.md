# Summary

This discord bot provides ease of access to data commonly utilized by Apex Legends users. If you want to check up on Apex in-game information **WITHOUT** launching the game, adding this bot to your server is a better alternative if you always leave your discord open. Otherwise you can stick to web searches or opening the game as that will fulfill the same purpose.
